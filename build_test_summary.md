## Relation to Neutral Client Implementation
The test failures and linting issues align with the ongoing work to complete the neutral client implementation for AI providers:

1. The MCP implementation is still being refined, particularly around XML format conversion
2. Integration between NeutralAnthropicClient and the MCP system needs improvement
3. Type safety enhancements are in progress as part of the SDK-independent architecture

## Current Status
The project is in active development with most core functionality working (91.4% passing tests). The MCP implementation and neutral client architecture are being actively refactored, with a focus on improving type safety and provider compatibility.
