# MCP Refactoring Checklist

This checklist tracks progress on the MCP refactoring tasks defined in the plan documents under `cline_docs/plan/`. Last updated: May 19, 2025.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core MCP Refactoring ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] 1.1 Establish new directory structure under `src/services/mcp/`
  - Created `core/`, `providers/`, `transport/`, `types/`, `client/`, `integration/`, and `management/` directories
  - Includes `__tests__/` directory for unit tests
- [x] 1.2 Define core type files
  - Implemented `McpToolTypes.ts` with neutral tool use interfaces
  - Implemented `McpProviderTypes.ts` with provider interfaces and type definitions
  - Implemented `McpTransportTypes.ts` with transport interfaces and config types
- [x] 1.3 Migrate/refactor core components
  - Successfully refactored `McpToolRegistry` with tool registration capabilities
  - Implemented `McpToolExecutor` as replacement for legacy system
  - Implemented `McpToolRouter` with format detection capabilities
  - Implemented `McpConverters` with format conversion utilities

## Phase 2: Provider & Transport Refactoring ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] 2.1 Migrate/refactor provider components
  - Implemented `EmbeddedMcpProvider` with proper interface implementation
  - Implemented `MockMcpProvider` for testing scenarios
  - Implemented `RemoteMcpProvider` for connecting to remote MCP servers
- [x] 2.2 Implement transport components
  - Created `SseTransport` with SSE server transport implementation
  - Created `StdioTransport` for stdio-based communication
  - Implemented `SseTransportConfig` with configuration options
- [x] 2.3 Update `EmbeddedMcpProvider` for transport integration
  - Provider now accepts transport instances in constructor
  - Properly delegates connection management to transport

## Phase 3: Integration & Client Refactoring ✓ COMPLETED
- [x] 3.1 Implement `McpClient` base class and refactor `SseClientFactory`
  - Created abstract `McpClient` base class with core client interface
  - Updated `SseClientFactory` to create clients using the MCP SDK
- [x] 3.2 Create integration layer
  - Implemented `McpIntegration` as facade for MCP system
  - Created `ProviderIntegration` for provider-specific logic
  - Implemented `WebviewIntegration` for webview-specific integration
- [x] 3.3 Update references across the codebase
  - All references to legacy components updated throughout the codebase

## Phase 4: Handler Updates & Feature Integration ◑ IN PROGRESS
- [x] 4.1 Update `BaseProvider`
  - Now properly initializes `McpIntegration` singleton
  - Registers common tools with proper schemas
  - Implements `processToolUse` method for tool delegation
- [x] 4.2 Update `OpenAiHandler`
  - Implements `extractToolCalls` and `hasToolCalls` helper methods
  - Correctly processes OpenAI tool calls format
  - Delegates to `processToolUse` and formats results
- [x] 4.3 Update `OllamaHandler`
  - Correctly detects and processes JSON tool use
  - Delegates to `processToolUse` and formats results
- [ ] 4.4 Update other provider handlers (e.g., `AnthropicHandler`)
- [ ] 4.5 Update remaining references in the codebase

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation ○ PENDING
- [ ] 5.1 Update/create unit tests for refactored components
- [ ] 5.2 Create integration tests for provider/transport interactions
- [ ] 5.3 Create end-to-end tests for complete MCP workflows
- [ ] 5.4 Perform manual testing across different providers
- [ ] 5.5 Analyze code coverage and improve as needed
- [ ] 5.6 Fix any bugs identified during testing

## Phase 6: Documentation Updates ○ PENDING
- [ ] 6.1 Update architectural notes to reflect implemented architecture
- [ ] 6.2 Create comprehensive developer documentation
- [ ] 6.3 Ensure code comments are up-to-date and helpful
