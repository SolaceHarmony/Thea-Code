# MCP Refactoring and SSE Implementation Plan

This directory contains detailed, actionable task plans for the refactoring of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation and the migration to SSE Transport within Thea Code.

These plans are derived from the architectural notes found in `cline_docs/architectural_notes/` and are intended to guide implementation, potentially by AI agents.

## Structure

Each file represents a major phase of the work:

1.  `01_foundation_core_mcp.md`: Setting up the structure and refactoring core MCP components.
2.  `02_provider_transport.md`: Refactoring MCP providers and implementing transport layers.
3.  `03_integration_client.md`: Refactoring integration layers and client components.
4.  `04_handler_updates_features.md`: Updating specific API handlers and integrating features like OpenAI function format.
5.  `05_testing_validation.md`: Comprehensive testing strategy and tasks.
6.  `06_documentation.md`: Documentation update tasks.

Refer to the specific files for detailed sub-tasks, file paths, code references, and relevant architectural context.
