# MCP Refactoring and SSE Implementation Plan

This directory contains detailed, actionable task plans for the refactoring of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation and the migration to SSE Transport within Thea Code.

These plans are derived from the architectural notes found in `cline_docs/architectural_notes/` and are intended to guide implementation.

## Implementation Status

As of May 19, 2025:

- **Completed Phases (Archived)**: Phases 1-3 have been completed and their plan documents are archived in the `archive/` folder
- **In Progress**: Phase 4 (Handler Updates & Features) is partially complete
- **Pending**: Phases 5-6 (Testing & Documentation) are yet to be fully implemented

## Structure

Current active plan files:

1.  [04_handler_updates_features.md](./04_handler_updates_features.md): Updating specific API handlers and integrating features like OpenAI function format (partially implemented).
2.  [05_testing_validation.md](./05_testing_validation.md): Comprehensive testing strategy and tasks.
3.  [06_documentation.md](./06_documentation.md): Documentation update tasks.
4.  [mcp_audit_checklist.md](./mcp_audit_checklist.md): Tracks the overall implementation progress.

### Archive

Completed plan documents are stored in the [`archive/`](./archive/) directory:

1.  [01_foundation_core_mcp.md](./archive/01_foundation_core_mcp.md): Setting up the structure and refactoring core MCP components.
2.  [02_provider_transport.md](./archive/02_provider_transport.md): Refactoring MCP providers and implementing transport layers.
3.  [03_integration_client.md](./archive/03_integration_client.md): Refactoring integration layers and client components.
