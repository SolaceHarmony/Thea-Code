# Phase 6: Documentation Updates

**Objective:** Update all relevant architectural and developer documentation to accurately reflect the refactored MCP system architecture, component structure, APIs, and usage patterns.

**Relevant Architectural Documents:**
*   All documents within `cline_docs/architectural_notes/` (especially those related to API handlers and MCP).
*   The newly created plan documents in `cline_docs/plan/`.

**Key Principles:**
*   **Accuracy:** Documentation must match the final implemented code.
*   **Clarity:** Explanations should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.
*   **Completeness:** Cover all significant changes and new components/APIs.
*   **Consistency:** Use consistent terminology and naming conventions established during the refactoring.

## Task 6.1: Update Architectural Notes

**Objective:** Revise the existing architectural documents in `cline_docs/architectural_notes/` to reflect the final state of the refactored MCP system.

**Details:**
*   **Scope:** All `.md` files within `cline_docs/architectural_notes/` that discuss or diagram the API handlers, tool use, MCP components, or related flows. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   `api_handlers/provider_handler_architecture.md`
    *   `api_handlers/unified_architecture.md`
    *   `tool_use/separation_of_concerns.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/mcp_comprehensive_guide.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/mcp_integration_architecture_diagram.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/mcp_integration_implementation.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/mcp_refactoring_implementation_details.md` (May become obsolete or merged)
    *   `tool_use/mcp/mcp_refactoring_plan.md` (Mark as completed/historical or update outcome)
    *   `tool_use/mcp/ollama_openai_mcp_integration.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/openai_function_format_integration.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/provider_mcp_integration_summary.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/provider_mcp_integration.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/README.md`
    *   `tool_use/mcp/sse_transport_implementation_plan.md` (Mark as completed/historical or update outcome)
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Review Each Document:** Read through each relevant document.
    2.  **Update Text:** Modify descriptions, explanations, and rationales to match the final implementation. Ensure discussions about future plans (like SSE transport or refactoring) are updated to reflect their completed status.
    3.  **Update Diagrams:** Regenerate or modify Mermaid diagrams (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, flowcharts) to accurately represent the final component names (e.g., `McpToolExecutor`, `EmbeddedMcpProvider`), directory structure (`core/`, `providers/`, etc.), and interaction flows.
    4.  **Update Code Snippets:** Ensure any code examples accurately reflect the final code structure, class/method names, and APIs.
    5.  **Consolidate/Archive:** Consider if `mcp_refactoring_implementation_details.md` and the plan documents (`mcp_refactoring_plan.md`, `sse_transport_implementation_plan.md`) should be archived or merged into the main guides now that the work is complete. The `README.md` in the `mcp` directory should be updated to point to the most relevant current documentation.

**Verification:**
*   Architectural documents accurately describe the final, refactored MCP system.
*   Diagrams visually match the implemented structure and flows.
*   Code snippets are correct and up-to-date.
*   Outdated planning documents are appropriately handled (archived, marked complete, or merged).

## Task 6.2: Update/Create Developer Documentation (API/Usage)

**Objective:** Ensure developers understand how to interact with the refactored MCP system, particularly for registering and potentially calling tools.

**Details:**
*   **Scope:** Potentially requires new documentation or updates to existing developer guides (location TBD - could be within `cline_docs` or alongside the code).
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Tool Registration API:** Document how developers should register new tools with the MCP system, likely via the `McpIntegration` facade or potentially a dedicated registration mechanism. Include:
        *   The structure of the `ToolDefinition` interface (`name`, `description`, `paramSchema` using JSON Schema, `handler`).
        *   Code examples of registering a simple tool.
        *   Explanation of where/when tools should be registered (e.g., in `BaseProvider` for common tools, potentially elsewhere for specific features).
    2.  **Tool Usage (Internal):** Document how internal components (like API Handlers) use the `McpIntegration.routeToolUse` method (or `processToolUse` in `BaseProvider`) to process tool calls detected from models.
    3.  **Component Overview:** Provide a high-level overview of the key MCP components in `src/services/mcp/` (Core, Providers, Transport, Client, Integration, Management) and their primary responsibilities, referencing the updated architectural diagrams.
    4.  **Configuration:** Document any relevant configuration options, especially for the `SseTransportConfig`.

**Verification:**
*   Clear documentation exists explaining how to register tools with the MCP system.
*   Documentation explains the internal flow for processing tool calls via `McpIntegration`.
*   A high-level overview of the refactored MCP components is available.
*   Configuration options are documented.

## Task 6.3: Update Code Comments (JSDoc/TSDoc)

**Objective:** Ensure code comments within the refactored files are accurate and reflect the new structure and logic.

**Details:**
*   **Scope:** All refactored and newly created files within `src/services/mcp/` and updated files in `src/api/providers/`.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Review Comments:** Read through existing JSDoc/TSDoc comments in the affected files.
    2.  **Update Descriptions:** Modify class, method, property, and type descriptions to accurately reflect their purpose in the refactored architecture.
    3.  **Update Params/Returns:** Ensure `@param` and `@returns` tags accurately describe function parameters and return values, especially where APIs changed.
    4.  **Add Comments:** Add comments to new components and complex logic sections where necessary for clarity.
    5.  **Remove Obsolete Comments:** Delete any comments that are no longer relevant after the refactoring.

**Verification:**
*   Code comments accurately describe the functionality of the refactored code.
*   Public APIs (classes, methods) have clear TSDoc documentation.
*   Obsolete comments have been removed.
