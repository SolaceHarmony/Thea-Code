**Thea Code** is an AI-powered **autonomous coding agent** that lives in your editor. It can:

- Communicate in natural language
- Read and write files directly in your workspace
- Run terminal commands
- Automate browser actions
- Integrate with any OpenAI-compatible or custom API/model
- **Use any model that supports function calling or MCP** with unified tool access
- **Work with Computer Use** on any model supporting vision and function calling
- Adapt its ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù and capabilities through **Custom Modes**

Whether you‚Äôre seeking a flexible coding partner, a system architect, or specialized roles like a QA engineer or product manager, Thea Code can help you build software more efficiently.

Check out the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed updates and fixes.

### üöÄ Universal Tool Integration

Thea Code features **Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration** across all 16 active AI providers, providing:

- **Unified tool access** across OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and all other supported providers
- **Automatic format conversion** supporting XML, JSON, and OpenAI function call formats
- **Computer Use capabilities** with any vision-enabled model
- **Extensible tool system** via MCP for unlimited custom functionality

> **Note**: Thea Code is a fork of Roo Code. We'd like to express our special thanks to the Roo Code team for their excellent work which served as the foundation for this project.

## Local Setup & Development

1. **Clone** the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SolaceHarmony/Thea-Code.git
```

1. **Install dependencies**:

```sh
npm run install:all
```

1. **Start the webview (Vite/React app with HMR)**:

```sh
npm run dev
```

1. **Debug**:
   Press `F5` (or **Run** ‚Üí **Start Debugging**) in VSCode to open a new session with Thea Code loaded.

Changes to the webview will appear immediately. Changes to the core extension will require a restart of the extension host.

Alternatively you can build a .vsix and install it directly in VSCode:

```sh
npm run build
```

A `.vsix` file will appear in the `bin/` directory which can be installed with:

```sh
code --install-extension bin/thea-code-<version>.vsix
```

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and publishing. Check our `CHANGELOG.md` for release notes.
