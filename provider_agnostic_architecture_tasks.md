## Current Project Status

The project has made significant progress in implementing a provider-agnostic architecture:

1. **Model Capability Detection**: A robust system for detecting model capabilities based on properties rather than hardcoded model checks has been implemented and is being used across multiple provider files.

2. **Neutral Client Implementation**: Two major neutral clients have been implemented (`NeutralAnthropicClient` and `NeutralVertexClient`), replacing direct SDK dependencies with fetch-based implementations.

3. **SDK Dependency Removal**: Several SDK dependencies have been removed, including `@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk`, reducing the project's external dependencies.

4. **Type Safety and Promise Handling**: Significant improvements have been made to type safety and promise handling, particularly in the MCP implementation and test files.

5. **MCP XML Format Conversion**: The XML format conversion has been improved with proper content type handling, type guards, XML escaping, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Complete UI component updates to use capability detection
2. **High Priority**: Fix failing tests, focusing on MCP-related failures
