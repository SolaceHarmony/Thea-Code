# Test Analysis Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings from running the test suite and provides recommendations for addressing the identified issues. The test run completed with 1704 tests in 52.001 seconds, resulting in:

- 1528 passing tests
- 168 failing tests
- 8 pending tests

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. MCP SDK Integration Issues

The most common error pattern is related to the MCP SDK initialization:

```
Error: Failed to find available port: Failed to initialize MCP SDK: Transport is not a constructor
```

This error occurs in the `SseTransport.ts` file when trying to dynamically import and use the `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` class from the MCP SDK:

```typescript
const mod = await import("@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js")
const Transport = mod.StreamableHTTPServerTransport as unknown as new (opts: Record<string, unknown>) => StreamableHTTPServerTransportLike
```

The error suggests that `mod.StreamableHTTPServerTransport` is not a constructor function as expected, which could be due to:
- The import path might be incorrect
- The exported class might have a different name or structure
- Jest might be handling dynamic imports differently in the test environment

### 2. Asynchronous Operation Issues

Many tests show the error:

```
ReferenceError: You are trying to `import` a file after the Jest environment has been torn down.
```

This indicates that some tests are trying to import modules after the Jest test environment has already been torn down, likely due to:
- Asynchronous operations not being properly awaited
- Promises not being properly handled or resolved
- Cleanup operations happening after test completion

### 3. Port Timeout Issues

There are timeout errors when waiting for ports to be used:

```
Timeout waiting for port 10000 to be used: Error: timeout
Timeout waiting for port 3001 to be used: Error: timeout
```

This suggests that:
- The port utility functions are working (they're detecting timeouts)
- Servers might not be starting up properly
- There might be race conditions in port assignment and server startup

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix MCP SDK Integration

1. **Verify MCP SDK Structure**: Check the actual structure of the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package to ensure the import path and class name are correct.

2. **Use Static Import Instead of Dynamic Import**: Consider replacing the dynamic import with a static import if possible:

   ```typescript
   import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js"
   ```

3. **Add Error Handling for Dynamic Import**: Enhance the error handling for the dynamic import to provide more specific error messages:

   ```typescript
   try {
     const mod = await import("@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js")
     if (!mod || typeof mod.StreamableHTTPServerTransport !== 'function') {
       throw new Error(`StreamableHTTPServerTransport is not a constructor (type: ${typeof mod.StreamableHTTPServerTransport})`)
     }
     // Rest of the code
   } catch (error) {
     // Enhanced error handling
   }
   ```

4. **Mock MCP SDK in Tests**: Consider mocking the MCP SDK in tests to avoid dependency on the actual implementation:

   ```typescript
   jest.mock("@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js", () => ({
     StreamableHTTPServerTransport: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
       start: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
       close: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
       handleRequest: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
     })),
   }))
   ```

### 2. Improve Asynchronous Operation Handling

1. **Ensure Proper Cleanup**: Make sure all asynchronous operations are properly cleaned up in the `afterEach` and `afterAll` hooks:

   ```typescript
   afterAll(async () => {
     await Promise.all([
       // Clean up all resources
       stopServer(),
       mcpIntegration.shutdown(),
       // Other cleanup operations
     ])
   })
   ```

2. **Use Jest's Done Callback**: For tests with complex async operations, consider using Jest's done callback:

   ```typescript
   it("should handle async operations", (done) => {
     someAsyncOperation()
       .then(() => {
         expect(result).toBe(expected)
         done()
       })
       .catch(done)
   })
   ```

3. **Increase Jest Timeout**: For tests that involve server startup and network operations, increase the Jest timeout:

   ```typescript
   jest.setTimeout(30000) // 30 seconds
   ```

### 3. Enhance Port Utility Functions

1. **Add Retry Mechanism**: Enhance the port utility functions to include a retry mechanism with exponential backoff:

   ```typescript
   export async function waitForPortInUse(
     port: number, 
     host = 'localhost', 
     retryTimeMs = 200, 
     timeOutMs = 10000,
     maxRetries = 5
   ): Promise<void> {
     let retries = 0
     let lastError: Error | undefined
     
     while (retries < maxRetries) {
       try {
         await tcpPortUsed.waitUntilUsed(port, host, retryTimeMs, timeOutMs / maxRetries)
         console.log(`Port ${port} is now in use (attempt ${retries + 1})`)
         return
       } catch (error) {
         lastError = error as Error
         retries++
         console.warn(`Retry ${retries}/${maxRetries} for port ${port}`)
       }
     }
     
     throw lastError || new Error(`Timeout waiting for port ${port} to be used after ${maxRetries} attempts`)
   }
   ```

2. **Improve Error Reporting**: Enhance error reporting in the port utility functions to provide more context:

   ```typescript
   export async function findAvailablePort(startPort = 3000, host = 'localhost'): Promise<number> {
     let port = startPort
     const maxPort = 65535
     const triedPorts: number[] = []
     
     while (port <= maxPort) {
       const available = await isPortAvailable(port, host)
       if (available) {
         return port
       }
       triedPorts.push(port)
       port++
       
       if (triedPorts.length > 100) {
         throw new Error(`Failed to find available port after trying ${triedPorts.length} ports (${triedPorts[0]}...${triedPorts[triedPorts.length - 1]})`)
       }
     }
     
     throw new Error(`No available ports found in range ${startPort}-${maxPort}`)
   }
   ```

3. **Add Fallback Mechanism**: Implement a fallback mechanism for port assignment:

   ```typescript
   export async function getPortWithFallback(preferredPort: number, host = 'localhost'): Promise<number> {
     try {
       const available = await isPortAvailable(preferredPort, host)
       if (available) {
         return preferredPort
       }
     } catch (error) {
       console.warn(`Error checking preferred port ${preferredPort}:`, error)
     }
     
     // Fallback to finding any available port
     return findAvailablePort(3000, host)
   }
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize MCP SDK Integration Fix**: This is the most critical issue affecting many tests.
2. **Update Test Setup and Teardown**: Ensure proper async handling in test setup and teardown.
3. **Enhance Port Utility Functions**: Implement the recommended improvements to the port utility functions.
4. **Run Tests in Smaller Batches**: Run tests in smaller, focused batches to isolate issues.
5. **Add More Logging**: Add more detailed logging to help diagnose issues in the test environment.

By addressing these issues, we should be able to significantly improve the test pass rate and make the tests more reliable and maintainable.
